 * This application demonstrates how to use the CUDA API to use multiple GPUs.
 *
 * Note that in order to detect multiple GPUs in your system you have to disable
 * SLI in the nvidia control panel. Otherwise only one GPU is visible to the
 * application. On the other side, you can still extend your desktop to screens
 * attached to both GPUs.
